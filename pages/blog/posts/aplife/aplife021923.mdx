My class started to prepare for the AP CSP create task by actually making it.

From the selection, I chose the project uses different language. (Note: my class usually uses code.org javascript app lab)

I decided to make the vocab quiz game using C++ and Qt 6. I've found the JSON file with words and their definitions and the C++ library for JSON.

I prepared the window design and worked on the utilities for loading, getting random words, etc. first.

But the JSON file didn't load as if it was in the documentation.

From the documentation, I just needed to write these lines:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp">
    {`
    ifstream file("dictionary.json");
    json data = json::parse(file);
    `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

But `json::parse` couldn't somehow read the content and always gave me error and crashed my app.

After hours of research, I finally managed to read and print out the content by:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp">
    {`
    QFile file(":dictionary.json");
    file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly);
    QString s;
    QTextStream s1(&file);
    s.append(s1.readAll());
    string p = s.toStdString();
    json data = json::parse(p);
    cout << data["0"]["after"] << endl;
    file.close();
    `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Why is it hard to just read JSON file?
