Today I took "Perfect Quiz" for AP Calc BC after school. Perfect quiz is the quiz that have to be perfect 100% on score to get a credit and it only has 15 minutes to complete it.

The topics are the graphs of basical functions, derivatives by definitions, special derivatives (trignometry, logarithm, etc.), and hard derivatives (quotient, product, logarithmic). 

I had to do more than 5 attempts to have perfect score and most weren't because of time up or critical careless mistakes. By the last one, my finger barely wrote "y" and my hand aching.

I'm glad to have Perfect Quiz done before the end of week.
