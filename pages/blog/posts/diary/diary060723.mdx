Today, I went to the nearest science center to preview the activities of what they are volunteering at there.
The volunteer starts in late summer and since it is very popular, they are required to fill out the form including the essay just like "Why Us" college essay.
I went several places to get the idea of what I will do if I were there.
It was fun.
