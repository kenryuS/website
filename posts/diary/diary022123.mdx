Today, I went to the volunteer for a nearby elementary school's Arts and Bots which is the combination of cardboard crafts and programming to make the simple yet creative robots.

Some created the flashy factory, one group made the shark biting robot that detects hand. And the wagging salamander.

I helped the "debugging" the code, but most were fixed with classic unplug and plug back in tactics. The board is the Arduino based and programmed using scratch like block language on students' iPad.

It was the last day working on their robots. In last 30 minutes, their parents came to see their art working. It was such a pleasure to see their smile.
