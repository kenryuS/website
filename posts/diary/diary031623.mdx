Today, I went to the Career Exploration and Opertunity Fair held in my high school.

I found the volunteer opertunity for La Roche Univ for tech help for elderly.

For most booth, it presented the swimming instruction/life gaurd and other summer related volunteers/jobs. And many were just out of range in term of my age.

So, there were limited number of booths that actually had the STEM related opertunities. To be exact, 2; La Roche and YMCA.

I really need to find some STEM related stuff.
